# tesseract-extention
 first attempt at a ocr chrome extension
 what I did for the intial commmit:
 setup basic chrome extention structure
 on image click, the object(?) for tesseract should read the image, extract the text, and print out the text in console,
 However there was a lot of struggling with acctually importing the tesseract library, tried tesseract.js, webpack, importing ect.
 After lots of searching will attempt the same extention with a different open source ocr next time.
